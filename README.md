# Dijkstra-s-algorithm-and-Bellman-Ford-algorithm
You are provided with the average commute time (in minutes) between each airport. Note that the commute time may be different for inbound and outbound flights due to uncontrolled conditions like weather and air traffic. Your task is to implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and determine the shortest commute time between any two airports in the network.
